## Design Principles

## 20-Jan-2024
### Coupling Cohesion
* Coupling -> ideally classes should be loosely coupled, so that one obj can be exchnaged for another
* Cohesion -> ideally one class should do only one work..

 ### Information Hiding
 * encapsulation enables this, ex: the public functions are the interfaces what is the actual logic/attribute is hidden inside
 *  Acess modifiers: Public, Private,Protected, Package

 ### Conceptual Integrity
 * Creating consistent software -> even if multiple people work on the software, it would look like it was made from one mind
 * Naming convention like snail_case, Camel case etc
