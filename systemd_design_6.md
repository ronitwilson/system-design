# Architecuteal Trade offs
## Quality Attributes
* System architectues **are not inherently good or bad**
* It is about meeting the requirements

### other points
* A a good practice to try to minimize complexity of design
* It is important to have detailed and up-to-date docu
### Design porcess guide lines
* Recognise the important quality attribs and prioritize them
    * Trade-offs should be noted
* involve a tech lead in design process
    * will help **identify any implementations that can pose a challenge**
* Taking a design approaches from perspective of diff stake holders
