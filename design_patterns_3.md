## Liskov Sibstitution principle
* its about inheritence
*  a subclass is expected to have the same characteristics and behave in the same way.
*  If a class, S, is a subtype of a class, B, then S can be used to replace all instances of B without changing the behaviors of a program
*  Invariant conditions that exist in the base class, must also remain invariant in the subclass
*  Immutable characteristics of a base class must not be changed by the subclass
