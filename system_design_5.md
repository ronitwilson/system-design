## Abstract Data types Use of Obect Oriented Programming
* Recall Object oriented principles
  * Abstraction -> simplify a concept
  * Encapsulation -> bundle data and functions
  * Decomposition -> break a whole into smaller part
  * Generalization -> factor out conceptual commonalities
* Identify data and put them in classes wich is the abstract data type

## Procedural programming paradigm
* break up the overall functionality of system into main program and subroutines
* Focus is on the data and behaviour of the function and how data moves through them
* Suited for **computation focused**
* Functions are like black box given an input will always have sme output (no state)
